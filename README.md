A comprehensive Python utility suite for synchronizing network configuration.
Currently supports pfSense router, and UniFi controllers. Includes DHCP reservation sync, certificate management, and network client administration.

## Background

I maintain a very large smart home network, with hundreds of IOT devices. I use pfSense as a router rather than a Unifi gateway, and Ubiquiti Unifi access points, as many others do.
The main reason I use pfSense is that my router is in my home office, and I need a 100% silent fanless 10 Gbase-t router. Ubiquiti does not produce one. Thus, I built my own fanless PC,
with an AMD 5700G APU, X470 motherboard, NH-D15S CPU cooler with fan removed, and X550-T2 dual 10 Gbase-t NIC. It has been my router for the last few years, and is completely silent.

Given this split between pfSense and Unifi, I selected the "source of truth" for my clients as the DHCP reservation table in pfSense, specifically the MAC, IPv4 reservation, hostname, and description.

## Workflow I personally use this to manage my Wifi IOT clients together in pfSense and Unifi
1. add them to the Wifi network using their respective app
2. find them in DHCP leases in pfsense
3. add IPv4 reservations, hostnames, and a detailed description, with the suffix "- Wifi"
4. run pfsense2unifi sync
5. clients are now in sync between both pfSense and Unifi GUIs

## Features

- 🔄 **DHCP Sync** - Exports DHCP static mappings from pfSense to UniFi as known clients
- 🔐 **NSS/NSPR TLS** - Enterprise-grade certificate handling with NSS database
- 📋 **Flexible Filtering** - Configurable client description suffix matching
- ✅ **Batch Verification** - Confirm clients were created in UniFi
- 🗑️ **Orphan Management** - Detect and optionally delete Unifi clients that are not present in pfSense
- 🔄 **Automatic Retry** - Exponential backoff for transient failures
- ✔️ **MAC Validation** - Strict format validation (colon delimiters)
- 📊 **Detailed Reporting** - Clear breakdown of success/failed/filtered clients

## Prerequisites

- a pfSense or pfSense+ router
- matching pfSense APIv2 package installed. Available at https://github.com/jaredhendrickson13/pfsense-api
- APIv2 key configured in pfSense API
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library
- NSS/NSPR libraries (for secure TLS)
- NSS tools (for certificate management)

## Installation

### Quick setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/madbrain76/netcon-sync.git
cd netcon-sync
```

2. Run the installer to create an isolated virtual environment:
```bash
./install_deps.sh
```

This creates a Python venv at `~/.venv-netcon-sync` with all dependencies.

3. Configure environment variables. See Configuration below.

4. Trust your CA or server certificate(s). See Certificate Management below.

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# UniFi Controller
export UNIFI_NETWORK_URL="https://192.168.1.100:8443"
export UNIFI_USERNAME="email@domain.com"
export UNIFI_PASSWORD="your_password"

# pfSense (for sync operations)
export PFSENSE_URL="https://192.168.1.1"
export PFSENSE_APIV2_KEY="your_api_key"
```

### Optional Environment Variables

```bash
export UNIFI_SITE_ID="default"              # UniFi site ID (default: "default")
export PFSENSE_DHCP_INTERFACE="lan"         # pfSense interface (default: "lan")
```

## Certificate Management

Trust a CA certificate:
```bash
./pfsense2unifi.py trust --ca /path/to/ca_cert.pem
```

Trust a server certificate:
```bash
./pfsense2unifi.py trust --server $UNIFI_NETWORK_URL
./unifi_climgr.py trust --server $PFSENSE_URL
```

## Disclaimer & Backup Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT - BACKUP BEFORE USE**

This tool directly modifies network configurations. Always:

- **BACKUP YOUR UNIFI CONFIGURATION BEFORE ANY MIGRATION** - Use UniFi's built-in backup feature or export your configuration
- Test in a non-production environment first
- Maintain backups of your configurations
- Review changes before running in production

Additional disclaimers:

- This tool was almost entirely vibe-coded with waywardgeek's Code Rhapsody, with minimal supervision and human review.
While I have been writing low-level C, C++ and assembly code, mainly in the field of enterprise security, for over 30 years. I can barely read Python, let alone write it. I'm comfortable using this tool in production in my own home. Please think thrice about using this tool in a business production environment. If you take that chance, I'd like to hear about it.
- Tested only with WSL and Ubuntu-24.04, and Debian Bookworm on Raspberry Pi 4
- Only U6-LR and NanoHD Unifi APs have been tested. Other Unifi APs, switches and gateways have not been tested, because I don't currently own any.
- Tested only with pfSense+ 25.07.1, pfSense APIv2, and Unifi Network 9.5.21 GA
- Not tested with Unifi OS

## Future plans
- Integrate pfsense2smokeping, for device monitoring
